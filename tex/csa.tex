\section{The Clang Static Analyzer}

\emph{Clang} is an open-source compiler, which is based on the \emph{LLVM} 
project \cite{lattner:clang}. This is a quickly improving project, 
supported by various companies including e.g. Google, Apple, Samsung, Ericsson, 
etc. Moreover it is becoming more and more popular in the circle of compilers. 
Since Clang is built outstandingly modular, it is not simply a compiler but a 
complete framework for creating developer tools on C/C++/Objective-C 
languages. Its API is well documented and the software is well tested due to 
the wide user base.


The Clang Static Analyzer (CSA) -- as it is indicated by its name -- build 
around the Clang compiler. It is one of the most quickly developing open source 
static analysis tool. In this section the principles and the relevant 
implementation details of the CSA will be presented.

\subsection{Symbolic execution}
The CSA uses the symbolic execution static analysis algorithm which means it 
simulates the possible execution paths and tries make conclusions. It basically 
interprets the source code but instead of using the actual semantics, it 
defines an abstract one and models the state according to the defined one.

Unknown values is represented by symbols/symbolic values. The CSA makes 
constraints on these symbolic values during the analysis of the different 
paths. Among others, these constraints came from the condition on which a path 
may bifurcate. There is a constraint solver module in the analyzer which 
handles these and tries to deduce the conflicts (exclude the non-feasible 
paths). This is important since a bug found on a non-feasible path is 
considered as a false positive. The analysis stops if all of the execution 
paths are simulated and checked or it reaches a predefined limit.

The memory is represented by a hierarchic memory region system 
\cite{clang:memmodel}, the correspondence between symbolic values and memory 
regions is tracked. The state of a given program point contains this relation 
of bindings as well.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\frame{\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/utvonalak}}
	\caption{The different execution paths of a simple function}
	\label{fig:exec_path}
\end{figure}

The analysis of the different execution paths can be done in any order, 
however, the evaluation of an expression (on a given path) must happen 
according to the language standard.  
During the simulation of the expressions the analyzer models the state of the 
program, means that one expression/instruction will create a transition between 
two states. A symbolic state can be viewed as a set of concrete program states, 
moreover, a simulated path is basically an analysis of these symbolic states in 
a well defined order. 

In order to be able to perform this process efficiently, the analyzer creates 
an inner model of the execution paths, called ExplodedGraph 
\cite{explodedgraph}. The nodes of the ExplodedGraph (called ExplodedNodes) are 
pairs, containing a symbolic program state and a program point. The program 
point determines the code location where the symbolic execution is in the 
source text. The directed edge between ExplodedNodes determines the sequencing.

Whenever the CSA encounters a branch in the symbolic execution, it creates new 
branches in the ExplodedGraph (see Fig \ref{fig:exploded_graph}). The paths
from the root to the leaves represents the analyzed paths. This means, that the 
number of leaves in the ExplodedGraph (and so the size of the graph) is 
exponential with respect to the branches in the execution. That results us a 
complex, precise but resource consuming method.

The ExplodedGraph is a simple directed acyclic graph. Whenever the analysis 
reachesan ExplodedNode which was already visited before, then the simulation 
will be stopped since the CSA would do the same (deterministic) reasoning what 
was already done. Note, that in case of concrete program states this would lead 
to an infinite loop, on the symbolic level this does not stand, since a
symbolic program state represents a set of real program states.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/explodedgraph.eps}
	\caption{The corresponding ExplodedGraph to the function presented on Fig 
		\ref{fig:exec_path}. The constraints made on the symbolic values are 
		shown next to the ExplodedNodes it belongs.}
	\label{fig:exploded_graph}
\end{figure}

In practice, the CSA constructs ExplodedNodes which does not represent any 
concrete transition between nodes but just help the simulation e.g. at some 
points the analyzer cleans up the stored but not necessary symbols and so it 
introduces a new node in order to smoothly fit this procedure into the flow of 
the analysis.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{img/eg}

	Static Analyzer for the function shown on Fig \ref{fig:exec_path}.}
	\label{fig:exploded_graph2}
\end{figure}

According to the properties of the model, it can be declared, that the symbolic 
execution is a path sensitive algorithm, i.e. reaching any program state the 
CSA knows the whole path leading to the simulated point. Thereby the displaying 
of the bugs shows not only the location of the bug but the corresponding 
execution path as well. This productively helps the programmer to understand 
the problem more easily, even spending less time on fixing the bug.

\subsection{Implementation details}
\subsubsection{The process of the analysis}
The CSA works on a translation unit, analyzing its content function by function. So the the inner model is constructed for an analysis of a function and its states are represented in the ExplodedGraph.

Whenever -- during the simulation of a given path -- the CSA encounters a branch in the execution, it splits the states creating more children for the actually simulated ExplodedNode, and so constructs new paths to analyze. Moreover, the condition which caused the branching is stored and the assumption whether it is true or false as well. This can potentially results in restriction on the symbolic values, and so we collect information which help us on the upcoming decisions.

It is possible that the simulation encounters a call of an other function.
At this point the called function will be evaluated/analyzed on the spot of the call, knowing the calling context. This allows us to make a more precise analysis of the called function, since we potentially have information on the possible values of its arguments. The analysis of a function while knowing the calling context is called an \textit{inline} analysis. The other possibility -- when we have absolutely no information or precondition on the values of a function and it is analyzed so -- is called an \textit{top level} analysis. 

In order to decrease the rate of false positive reports and make the analysis more time efficient, the CSA will not reanalyze a function as top level if it was already analyzed as an inline function. The analyzer tries to inline as much function as possible. This is reached by creating the function call graph of the translation unit and the analysis order of the functions is determined by a post-traversal-walk TODO on this call graph.

As it was mentioned earlier, branches in the execution lead to an exponential number of \texttt{ExplodedNode}s.
This combinatorial explosion is handled in the Static Analyzer by restricting or even stopping
the analysis when given conditions are fulfilled. Terminating the analysis 
process may cause loss of potential true positive results, but it is 
indispensable for maintaining a reasonable resource consumption regarding the 
memory and CPU usage. 

These conditions are modeled by the concept of budget.
The budget is a collection of limitations on the shape of the \texttt{ExplodedGraph}.
These limitations include:
\begin{enumerate}  
	\item The maximum number of traversed nodes in the \texttt{ExplodedGraph}. 
	If 	this number is reached then the analysis of the simulated function stops.
	\item The size of the simulated call stack. When a function call is 
	reached then the analysis continues in its body as if it was inlined to the 
	place of call (interprocedural). There are several heuristics that may control 
	the	behavior of inlining process. For example the too large functions are 
	not	inlined at all, and the really short functions are not counted in the 
	size of	call stack.
	\item The number of times a function is inlined. The idea behind this
	constraint is that the more a function is analyzed, the less likely it 
	is that a 	bug will appear in it. If this number is reached then that 
	function will not be inlined again in this \texttt{ExplodedGraph}.
	\item The number of times a basic block is processed during the 
	analysis. This	constraint limits the number of loop iterations. When this 
	threshold is reached the currently analyzed execution path is aborted.
\end{enumerate}

The budget expression can be used in two ways. Sometimes it means the
collection of the limitations above, sometimes it refers to one of these
limitations. This will always be distinguishable from the context.

\subsubsection{The building process of the model}
The syntactic and semantic information of variables, functions and types
are required to perform the above described simulation.
A szimulációhoz szükséges a különböző változók, függvények, típusok 
szintaktikus és szemantikus tulajdonságainak ismerete.
Ezen információk a C/C++ forrásfájlok esetén a fordítás során is szükségesek.
A fordítók ezeket egy saját, jól struktúrált adatszerkezetben tárolják, egy 
absztrakt szintaxisfát építenek fel a kód elemzése során.
A gyakorlatban ez konkrét (adott platformra jellemző) információkat, illetve a 
szemantikus tulajdonságokat is tartalmazza.
Sőt, számos fordító esetében kör is előfordulhat benne. Ilyenkor csupán csak 
történeti okokból hívják az adott adatszerkezetet fának.
A felsorolt tulajdonságok alapján ez az adatszerkezet a szimbolikus végrehajtás 
számára nélkülözhetetlen információkat tartalmaz. 
Ebben rejlik a fő motivációja annak, hogy egy statikus elemző rendszert egy 
fordító köré építsünk,
amely képes az alapvetően szükséges információk strukturált előállítására. 
Fontos még, hogy az adatszerkezetben
tárolt információk helyessége jól tesztelt, hiszen minden fordítás során a 
kódgeneráláskor ugyanezek az
információk lesznek felhasználva. A CSA a Clang fordító által épített 
szintaxisfát használja.

Ezek után már elegendő információ áll rendelkezésre az elemző rendszer számára,
hogy (pár köztes lépésen keresztül) képes legyen felépíteni a szimulálás során 
létrejövő Exploded Graphot.

Az elemzés során használt modellt (az Exploded Graphot) a CSA egy
optimalizált \textit{mélységi bejárás} segítségével építi fel és járja be 
egyszerre.
Ennek fő oka, hogy a mélységi bejáráshoz elegendő csak az adott útvonalhoz
tartozó csúcsok memóriában tartása. Ezzel szemben egy szélességi bejárás során
az összes elemzett útvonalat a memóriában kell tartanunk az útvonalérzékenység
megtartása érdekében. Továbbá a mélységi bejárás esetén kevesebb kontextus 
váltásra van
szükség: az adott útvonal elemzése során kevés memóriarégió és szimbólum kerül
felhasználásra, nagyobb eséllyel találhatóak meg a felhasznált adatszerkezetek a
processzor gyorsítótárában, így hatékonyabban tudjuk végrehajtani az 
elemzést.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/memoria.eps}
	\caption{The different traverses of the Exploded Graph and the parts which 
	needs to be stored in the memory (black). Depth first search (left) and 
	breath first search (right).}
	\label{fig:bejaras_szemleltetes}
\end{figure}

Moreover, in order to use less memory during the analysis, the CSA clears the ExplodedNodes which are unnecessarily kept in the memory. This mainly means, the nodes that are created to help the analysis but not representing concrete state changes in the actual running of the program.

%%%%
An important technical note is that the building 
of the \texttt{ExplodedGraph} is based on the \texttt{Control Flow Graph} 
(\texttt{CFG}) of the functions. The \texttt{CFG} represents a source-level, 
intra-procedural control flow of a 
statement. This statement can potentially be an entire function body, or just a 
single expression. The \texttt{CFG} consists of \texttt{CFGBlocks} which are 
simply containers of statements. The \texttt{CFGBlocks}s essentially represent 
the basic blocks of the code but can contain some extra custom information. 
Although basic blocks and \texttt{CFGBlocks} are technically different, in the 
rest of the article the term basic blocks will be used for \texttt{CFGBlocks} 
as well for the sake of easier understanding and better illustration.

Thus during the analysis -- based on the function CFGs -- an 
\texttt{ExplodedGraph} is built up. A 
node of this graph (called \texttt{ExplodedNode}) contains a 
\texttt{ProgramPoint} (which determines the location) and a \texttt{State} 
(which contains any known information at that point). Its paths from the root 
to the leaves are modeling the different execution paths of the analyzed 
function. Whenever the execution encounters a branch, a corresponding branch 
will be created in the \texttt{ExplodedGraph} during the simulated 
interpretation.
