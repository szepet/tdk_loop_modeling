\section{Future work}
The heuristic patterns for completely unrolled loops could be extended to 
involve loops whose bound is a known variable which is not changed in the body. 
Furthermore, even more general rules would be beneficial: consider loops where  
the value variables are known at the beginning and they are affected by a known 
constant change by every iteration. These improvements have not been implemented
yet due to some technical and framework limitations.

During the widening process we invalidate any possibly changed information. 
However, a change made on a pointer could mean that we need to 
invalidate all variables due to the lack of advanced pointer analysis. Therefore, 
introducing pointer analysis algorithms to the analyzer could help to develop a 
more precise invalidation process.

The infrastructural improvements enable the analyzer to provide entry points 
for bug finding modules (checkers) on loop entrances/exits and identify the 
currently simulated loop for every \texttt{ExplodedNode}. On top of these entry 
points new checkers can be implemented e.g. a check for finding possible 
infinite loops.
