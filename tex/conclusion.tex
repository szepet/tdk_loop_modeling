\section{Conclusion}

Two alternative approaches was introduced for improving the simulation of loops during symbolic 
execution. These were implemented and subsequently evaluated on various open 
source projects, with a clear improvement of code coverage in general. The new methods make it possible to explore previously skipped, feasible execution paths, especially when both of them are used in conjunction.

The required changes done to the underlying infrastructure should also ease the 
implementation of future enhancements. In particular, information tracked by the 
analysis about location contexts were expanded with additional fields.
While code coverage was measured to have increased by an average of 0.8\% and the 
number of explored execution paths by an average of 16\%, there 
was a noticeable performance penalty as well. A general increase in the runtime was observed, with an average of 9.5\% . The number of simulated paths also increased proportionally with the time taken, suggesting this time was well 
spent. In conclusion, if the user does not mind taking $\sim$10\% more time
for a more comprehensive analysis, then it is beneficial to enable the proposed
feature set by default.
